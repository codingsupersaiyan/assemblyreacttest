# Running project
- Install dependencies with node using 'npm install'.
- Run through localhost using 'npm start'.
- Website is being served through a heroku server at [https://test-react-2021.herokuapp.com/], heroku servers might take a while to spin up initially. Please be patient.

# Project Notes
- Heroku server is using CD/CI pipeline.
- Not using any tree-shaking techniques for production. Not sure if React has these compiling techniques.
- Github repository can be found at [https://github.com/codingsupersaiyan/assemblyreacttest]
- Time alloted: around 9 hours. I am fairly new to react, so I spent a lot of time with researching various techniques. I got stuck while trying to implement a scroll to load / infinite load technique and spent a lot of time trying to get it to work.
- This project is mobile responsiveness.
- Thanks for the opportunity. I had a lot of fun learning React and doing this project.
